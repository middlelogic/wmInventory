#### Instructions

* Use the MeteorJS stack to create an inventory app that is available after signing in.
* Each user will have their own inventory.  Each inventory item will consist of a SKU and a quantity. Have CRUD functionality.
* Log your time by using a commit at the start of your work and at the end.
* Just create an empty commit (or make a small change: a space in the readme or something) with message START WORK, and END WORK respectively.
* DO NOT squash your commits at the end, I want to see the individual commits.  
* To start, use the MeteorJS generator
* You can upload your work to github when youâ€™re done and send me a link.
